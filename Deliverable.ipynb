    "**Description:** The video is about a locker-room incident at a Gold’s Gym in the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. It says that on November 3, 2025, Tish Hyman confronted Grant Kyle Freeman in the women’s locker room, describing Freeman as “a man identifying as a woman,” and that Hyman felt violated while changing. The gym revoked Hyman’s membership and had her escorted out by police, while Freeman faced no repercussions under the gym’s gender-identity policy. The slide claims the incident sparked widespread online support for Hyman, including boycott calls and negative reviews aimed at the gym. It also notes that reactions have been polarized, especially in debates around trans rights.\n",

Also code 1 if the words \"unisex\", \"family bathroom\", \"gender neutral\" come up in a comment, code 0 for all else. Concept 2: No, biological men should not have access to women's locker rooms code 1. If comments say \"No\" \"absolutely not\" \"unisex\" \"gender neutral\" or \"family bathroom\" code 1.

    "\n",
    "**Brief Reflection:** We didn't exactl *change* our prompt. Rather, we added to it. By giving the LLM more context and being clearer with what types of phrases we deemed applicable to a concept. As Cameron said durng lecture, we needed to be very explicit about what is considered applicable for a certain concept, the clearer and succinct we are the better our scores will be. This is exactly what happened. However, we still needed humans to watch the video to be able to figure out what generic yes's and no's meant in the comment section. The social and contextual framing is something that the LLM would have likely missed on its own.\n",

    "Our project looked at how people reacted to a TikTok about a locker-room incident at a Gold’s Gym in Los Angeles, where Tish Hyman confronted Grant Kyle Freeman in the women’s locker room and was later banned from the gym. Our main question was: **Does the audience of this video believe that biological males should have access to women’s locker rooms?** To study this, we coded the comments using two concepts: Concept 1 was “Yes, biological males should have access to women’s locker rooms”, and Concept 2 was “No, biological males should not have access to women’s locker rooms” At first, our prompt was vague, which led to low inter-rater reliability scores (concept 1: -0.297; concept 2: 0.342) and showed how easily a model can misread nuanced social attitudes when the task is underspecified.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then updated the prompt to be much more specific about what should count as “support” or “opposition,” and we explicitly included terms like “unisex,” “gender-neutral,” and “family bathroom” as indicators of people trying to find alternative, more inclusive arrangements. After this change, our reliability scores improved a lot (concept 1: 0.730; concept 2: 0.703). This suggests that LLMs can be useful tools for studying public opinion on sensitive social issues, but only when researchers carefully define the constructs and anticipate the kinds of language people might use to express safety concerns, inclusion, or compromise. Even with better prompts, though, the model still struggled with sarcasm, inside jokes, and comments where users mixed humor with serious political views, reminding us that human judgment and ethical reflection remain essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what the audience actually thinks, our results suggest that **most commenters do not support** allowing biological males to use women’s locker rooms. Concept 2 (opposition) got the most 1’s overall, while concept 1 (support + unisex/gender-neutral suggestions) showed up less often. However, comments aligned with concept 1 tended to get **more replies**, which we think is because that position is seen as more controversial and therefore draws more pushback and debate. When we looked at age patterns, commenters who didn’t clearly align with either concept were mostly in the 25–34 range. Those who aligned with concept 1 were generally on the younger side of 18–24 (likely 18–21), while those aligned with concept 2 were also 18–24 but slightly older on average (around 21–24). Overall, we conclude that this TikTok audience leans against allowing biological males in women’s locker rooms, but there’s a smaller, very vocal group arguing for access or for unisex/gender-neutral alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis is limited by the fact that TikTok comments are not a representative sample of the public, and that we relied on an LLM instead of full human coding. Still, the project helped us see how computational methods can surface patterns in online discourse about gender and public space, and it raised important questions about how we might design future research—and future platforms—that better support nuanced, respectful conversations on trans rights and shared safety."
