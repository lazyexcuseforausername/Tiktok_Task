    "**Video:** https://www.tiktok.com/@cees_evryting/video/7569032934200511799?q=gym%20attire%20controversy&t=1762792093968\n",

    "**Description:** The video is about a locker-room incident at a Gold’s Gym in the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. It says that on November 3, 2025, Tish Hyman confronted Grant Kyle Freeman in the women’s locker room, describing Freeman as “a man identifying as a woman,” and that Hyman felt violated while changing. The gym revoked Hyman’s membership and had her escorted out by police, while Freeman faced no repercussions under the gym’s gender-identity policy. The slide claims the incident sparked widespread online support for Hyman, including boycott calls and negative reviews aimed at the gym. It also notes that reactions have been polarized, especially in debates around trans rights.\n",

    "**Research Question:** Does the audience of this video believe that biological males should have access to women's locker rooms?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept 1:** Yes, biological males should have access to women's locker rooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept 2:** No, biological males should not have access to women's locker rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First LLM Prompt:** You are a research assistant. \n",
    "                You will receive a series of tiktok comments, \n",
    "                please code for if biological males should have access to womens locker rooms or not. \n",
    "                \n",
    "**Inter-rater reliability score:** concept 1: -0.297 concept 2: 0.342\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final LLM Prompt:** You are a research assistant. \n",
    "                You will receive a series of tiktok comments, \n",
    "                please code for if biological males should have access to womens locker rooms or not. Concept 1: Yes, biological men should have access to womens locker rooms code 1. Also code 1 if the words \"unisex\", \"family bathroom\", \"gender neutral\" come up in a comment, code 0 for all else. Concept 2: No, biological men should not have access to women's locker rooms code 1. If comments say \"No\" \"absolutely not\" \"unisex\" \"gender neutral\" or \"family bathroom\" code 1. Code 0 for all else \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inter-rater reliability score:** concept 1: 0.730 concept 2: 0.703\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief Reflection:** We didn't exactl *change* our prompt. Rather, we added to it. By giving the LLM more context and being clearer with what types of phrases we deemed applicable to a concept. As cCameron said durng lecture, we needed to be very explicit about what is considered applicable for a certain concept, the clearer and succinct we are the better our scores will be. This is exactly what happened. However, we still needed humans to watch the vdeo to be able to figure out what generic yes's and no's meant in the comment section. This is something that the LLM would have failed at on its own.\n",

    "The graph above displays which age group commentors fell into based on which concept group they fell into. We can see that users who created comments aligning with neither concept were somewhere between the ages of 25-34. Commentors aligning with concept one were generally between ages 18-24 but still on the younger side of that spectrum (so likely 18-21). Commentors aligning with concept 2 were also between the ages of 18-24, but on the later end of the spectrum (so likely 21-24 here). "
